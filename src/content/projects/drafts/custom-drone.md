## Key Highlights
- **Component Sourcing**: Researched and sourced individual parts such as motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), flight controller, propellers, and frame components.
- **Assembly**: Carefully assembled all the components, ensuring proper wiring and weight distribution to achieve balanced flight.
- **Programming**: Utilized **Arduino** or **Betaflight** to program the flight controller. Configured the drone to handle manual flight inputs as well as GPS-based autonomous flight modes.
- **First Flight**: After successful calibration and configuration, the drone had its maiden flight, which was a culmination of months of work and learning.

## Technology Stack
- **Hardware**: 
    - Frame: Carbon fiber frame for lightweight durability.
    - Motors: Brushless DC motors (1400KV).
    - Flight Controller: F4/F7 flight controller with Betaflight firmware.
    - ESC: 30A ESCs for motor control.
    - GPS Module: For GPS-assisted flight modes.
- **Software**: 
    - Betaflight for firmware control and tuning.
    - Arduino IDE for custom scripts and fail-safes.

## Challenges
- **Component Compatibility**: Ensuring that all sourced components were compatible and worked seamlessly was a major challenge.
- **Programming**: Learning to tune the flight controller for stable flight, especially with GPS and autonomous flight features.
- **Mechanical Design**: Balancing the weight of the drone to ensure smooth flight and proper control, while also dealing with factors like vibration and heat dissipation.

## Learning Outcomes
- Acquired a deeper understanding of UAV systems, including the importance of sensor calibration, battery management, and motor control.
- Gained hands-on experience in circuit design, wiring, and troubleshooting mechanical issues.
- Learned how to troubleshoot hardware-software integration issues, particularly with the flight controller and sensors.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding **FPV (First-Person View)** capabilities with a live video feed from the drone to enhance manual control.
- Integrating obstacle avoidance sensors and AI-based object tracking.
- Improving battery life and flight time through enhanced power management.
