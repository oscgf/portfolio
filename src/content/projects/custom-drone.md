## Challenges

One of the significant challenges faced during the project was **component compatibility**. Ensuring that all sourced components were compatible and worked seamlessly together was crucial for the success of the build. This involved verifying specifications and understanding how different parts interacted, which could be quite complex given the variety of components available.

Another challenge was **programming**. Learning to tune the flight controller for stable flight required time and effort. It involved understanding the intricacies of the flight controller’s settings and making adjustments to achieve optimal performance. This process was essential to ensure safe and effective drone operation.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I **acquired a deeper understanding of UAV systems**, gaining insights into essential aspects such as sensor calibration, battery management, and motor control. This comprehensive knowledge allowed me to appreciate the intricate details that contribute to the overall performance of the drone.

Additionally, I **gained hands-on experience** in circuit design, wiring, and troubleshooting mechanical issues. This practical experience was invaluable, as it helped me develop skills that are crucial for building and maintaining UAV systems.

I also **learned how to troubleshoot hardware-software integration issues**, particularly focusing on the interactions between the flight controller and various sensors. Understanding these integration challenges is essential for achieving smooth operation and reliable performance in UAV systems.

## Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, one of the **future enhancements** I plan to implement is the addition of autonomous flight features. This improvement will not only increase the drone's capabilities but also enhance its functionality in various applications.
