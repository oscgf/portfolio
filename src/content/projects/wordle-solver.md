# Wordle Solver

The **Wordle Solver** is a smart assistant built to enhance your gameplay experience in the popular Wordle game. Designed to take your guesses and guide you toward the correct word, it utilizes logical algorithms and a word database to calculate the most probable solutions, ensuring that you can crack the puzzle efficiently.

## Features:
- **Interactive Input**: The solver allows users to input their guesses and results (correct letters and their positions, incorrect letters, etc.).
- **Advanced Algorithm**: Behind the scenes, the solver uses elimination techniques and probability models to refine the list of potential answers based on your input.
- **Efficient Strategy**: By suggesting words that maximize information gain, the solver helps you narrow down possibilities quickly, often within a few guesses.

## Technology Stack:
- **Language**: Python/JavaScript
- **Algorithm**: Greedy algorithms and basic word frequency analysis
- **Libraries**: Pandas (for handling word lists), Flask (for web deployment), or vanilla JavaScript for a browser-based version.

## Challenges:
One of the key challenges in building the Wordle Solver was optimizing the word elimination process. The initial brute-force approach was slow for larger datasets, so improvements in data structures and the implementation of more efficient filtering techniques were necessary.

## Future Improvements:
- Integration with real-time gameplay using browser extensions.
- Support for multiple languages (not just English).
- Advanced analytics to offer hints and feedback on optimal guessing strategies.
