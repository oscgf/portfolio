## Features
- Scrapes job offers from UC3M's job offers page.
- Detects new job offers or changes in the offer's status.
- Sends an email notification with the details of new offers.
- Supports running via GitHub Actions for automation.

## Prerequisites

### Local Setup
- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your local machine.
- **Gmail Account** (if using Gmail for notifications):
  - You will need to generate an **App Password** for your Gmail account. [Follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833) to generate an App Password.
  
### GitHub Setup
- **GitHub Account**: You'll need a GitHub account to use GitHub Actions.
- **GitHub Secrets**: Set up the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository to securely manage email credentials (more information below).

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oscgf/atenea-scraper.git
cd atena-scraper
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
For local development, create a .env file in the project root with the following content:

```bash
SENDER_EMAIL=your-email@gmail.com
PASSWORD=your-app-password
RECEIVER_EMAIL=recipient-email@gmail.com
```

- `SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address that will send the notifications.
- `PASSWORD`: Your Gmail App Password. [Instructions for setting up App Passwords](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833).
- `RECEIVER_EMAIL`: The email address that will receive job alerts.

### 4. Running the Scraper Locally
You can run the scraper manually by executing the Python script:

```bash
python your_script.py
```

## GitHub Actions Automation
This project is also configured to run automatically using GitHub Actions. The GitHub Actions workflow is located in `.github/workflows/scraper.yml`.

### 1. Setup GitHub Secrets
In order to send email notifications using GitHub Actions, you need to configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

1. Go to your **GitHub repository**.
2. Click on the **Settings** tab.
3. On the left sidebar, go to **Secrets and variables > Actions**.
4. Click **New repository secret** and add the following secrets:

 - `SENDER_EMAIL`: Your sender email address.
 - `PASSWORD`: Your email app password.
 - `RECEIVER_EMAIL`: The email address that will receive notifications.
 
If you want to commit and push automatically the changes when the job offers ara updated, ensure that `GITHUB_TOKEN` is enabled and has write permissions:

5. Navigate to **Settings > Actions > General**.
6. Scroll down to **Workflow permissions**.
7. Ensure **"Read and write permissions"** is selected for `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
8. Also, check **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** if you plan to use that in the future.

### 2. Running the Workflow Manually
To run the workflow manually (in case you don't want to wait for the scheduled time):

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select the **Job Alert Email** workflow.
3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right side to manually trigger the job.

### 3. Scheduled Workflow
The scraper is configured to run every day at 9:00 AM UTC. You can change this schedule by modifying the `cron` expression in `.github/workflows/scraper.yml`:

```bash
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * *'  # Change this to your preferred schedule
```

## Troubleshooting

### Enabling Gmail App Passwords
If you are using a Gmail account to send email notifications, you will need to enable an App Password. This is a security measure by Google to allow third-party apps to send emails securely.

1. **Enable 2-Step Verification** for your Gmail account: [Google 2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).
2. **Generate an App Password**: Go to [App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords), choose "Mail" as the app, and "Other" as the device. Copy the generated password and use it in your `.env` file or GitHub Secrets.

### Debugging Locally
If you encounter any issues while running the scraper locally, make sure:

- Your email credentials are correct in the `.env` file.
- You are not blocking SMTP connections (some networks may block ports).

You can also review logs in GitHub Actions for any issues with the automation process.
