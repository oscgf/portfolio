##  Abstract

This project presents the initial design of a K-band radar hardware operating in the 18–27 GHz range. The design focuses on an active corporate feed network for a three-element antenna array, chosen to achieve optimal directivity and maximize range. The design incorporates a low-noise amplifier and a three-port power divider, configured using the AWR software, and explores radiating elements with CST Microwave Studio. Key specifications include precise gain, noise, and impedance requirements to ensure reliable performance at 18.66 GHz, with strict dimensions for manufacturability. CST analysis covers both infinite and finite ground planes, impacting radiation characteristics and efficiency. Finally, the integration of the active feed network and the antenna array in AWR is assessed, with simulations indicating some deterioration in isolation and phase stability. Future work involves refining the layout and optimizing integration for a manufacturable, fully functional radar array.
